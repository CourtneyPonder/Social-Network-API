# Social-Network-API

This application is creating an API from scratch for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. You'll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.jsLinks to an external site. and MongooseLinks to an external site. packages, you may also optionally use a JavaScript date library of your choice or the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.
